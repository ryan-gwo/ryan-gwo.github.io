Hi! I'm Yuze Guo, currently a physics undergraduate student at the [School of Physics and Technology](http://physics.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](https://whu.edu.cn). Before this, I have completed both my middle and high school studies at [The Affiliated High School of South China Normal University](https://www.hsfz.net.cn/homepage/index.jsp) as a member of the Physics Olympiad Group. I expect to pursue my PhD degree in astrophysics at Peking University starting from fall 2026.

My research interest lies in high energy astrophysics, specifically, the study of gravitational waves, cosmology, and multi-messenger astronomy.

I started my systematic learning in astronomy during high school as a part of the activities related to [HFAA](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/c_5QRKZvjZMZ0oLyByOj6A) (The Astronomy Association of Affiliated High School of SCNU). Apart from amateur observations and lectures, I have also participated in astronomy Olympiads, and have obtained gold medals in both national ([CNAO 2020](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/PhGB4nSSOF43m1jnaHsBWQ)) and international ones ([IOAA 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211207205130/https://www.ioaa2021.com/)).
